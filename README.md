# Master--Gradient-Descent
Python Code to implement the Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is an optimization technique used to identify the best-fit line for a given training dataset. In this project, our objective is to determine the optimal values of m (slope) and b (intercept) that define the linear equation representing the relationship between the input variables X and the output values y. By applying Gradient Descent, we iteratively adjust m and b to minimize the cost function and obtain the most accurate linear model for the data.
